# STAT 159/259 - Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science

Materials for the Fall 2017 edition of UC Berkeley's STAT 159/259 - Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science course.

## Credits

While started from a fresh repository, this course draws on materials created by Jarrod Millman for the [2015 edition of the same course](https://github.com/jarrodmillman/stat159-fall2015) and the accompanying [lecture notes](https://github.com/jarrodmillman/rcsds).  Full credit for the original materials goes to Jarrod and collaborators on that repo. Anything copied here is hosted under the same licensing terms as the original (BSD).  Because I am restructuring the course completely, it didn't make sense to fork/continue off the original repo.
