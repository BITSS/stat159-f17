# Lab 4

## First Quiz
Today we have our first quiz.
For this (and future) quizes we'll be using the SCF accounts we set up last time.
On the SCF accounts we're using `nbgrader`, a system which allows for instructors to create assignments in Jupyter notebooks and for students to complete and submit assignments in those notebooks.

To access the quiz, navigate to [Jupyter Hub on the SCF servers](https://jupyter.stat.berkeley.edu:8443/hub/login) (shortened url: http://bit.ly/2wvKG7r.

Log in with your username (`s159-X` where `X` ranges from 1-100) and password that you set up last lab.

To take the quiz, navigate to the "Assignments" tab. Under "Released Assignments" you should see `quiz1_lab1`. Click on `Fetch` next to download the assignment, `quiz1_lab1` will now move to "Downloaded Assignments". Complete the questions by clicking on the drop down menu and selecting each problem (`p1`, `p2`, and `p3`). When finished with the assignment, click on "Validate" for each problem to ensure that you've completed it, then press "Submit".
