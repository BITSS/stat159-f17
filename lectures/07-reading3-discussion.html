<p>“I somewhat disagree with the author of “Treating Code as an Essay” when
it comes to brevity of code being a good thing. I agree with the overall
goal of creating code that is explanatory and easy to understand. While
this would discourage clutter, I think extra lines of code can sometimes
be useful, especially in scientific computing. For example, using numpy
to reshape data and then solve a least squares problem can be done in
one line. But splitting up the reshaping steps and the least squares
function call is likely better for readability.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think code should try to balance readability with
sufficient context. Documentation can’t make up for cryptic code - and I
think programmers should always err on the side of over-explanation,
since one programmer’s “obvious” is often another’s “convoluted” or even
“impossible.”</p>

<h2>Point # 2, on simplicity for users and developers:<a class="headerlink" href="#Point-#-2,-on-simplicity-for-users-and-developers:" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>“The main themes of both of those chapters seem to be <strong>tradeoffs
between simplicity for users and simplicity for developers</strong> [emphasis
mine]. Both authors mention special cases where the constructions were
not optimized, even though they knew it would bring (at least non-zero,
even if small) performance gains to users, because it would complicate
the development of those objects substantially. It is hard for me to
tell for certain, but I imagine that Matsumoto might be extremely in
disagreement with the decision to compromise at all ever in favor of
simplicity for language developers over simplicity/performance for
end-users. Also, to be fair/judicious, it is not only Python developers
who often seem to have this attitude – I have read several
posts/comments by Hadley Wickham, where he explicitly states that he
doesn’t feel the need to optimize the dplyr utilities to the extent
data-table does, because he imagines that in most use cases the improved
performance would not be necessary. Maybe that’s true, but on the other
hand <strong>that also seems to be sacrificing simplicity for the user (i.e.
“why is my code running so slow? and how can I fix it?”)</strong> in favor of
simplicity for the developer. Also, the developers of data-table also
seem to have the same attitude as well – they are willing to choose a
syntax which is very unfamiliar and/or non-intuitive and/or difficult to
acquire, because it simplifies the process of developing the package for
them, but it makes the package much more difficult to use for most
end-users. I.e. this type of thinking is clearly present in both R and
Python developers. Indeed, Matsumoto certainly couldn’t be the only one
if he disagreed with such thinking (I’m not sure that he would be, since
the developers do compromise back-end simplicity a little bit for
front-end simplicity, just not completely) common for developers of
high-level language backends – <strong>the whole point/existence of the new
Julia language seems to be predicated on researchers frustrated with
high-level language developers who weren’t willing to optimize their
code completely, in spite of the benefits it would give to end users</strong>.
(E.g. at one point the NumPy developer literally says “People wishing to
get the small speed gain available for contiguous cases are assumed to
be knowledgeable enough to write the simple loop themselves (bypassing
the iterator entirely).” referring to making a change in the
Python/NumPy source/C code. This seems, frankly, more like laziness on
the part of the designer/engineer, than good design.) “</p>
